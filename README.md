## Project overview

This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, data integrity checking, and basic analytics using SQL, with visualization integration in Python. I used SQL for data preparation and data cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into customer purchasing behaviors. Python was used to create visualizations, and forecasting. This project simply shows understanding of Data Analytics through python.
