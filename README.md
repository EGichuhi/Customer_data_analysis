# E-commerce Data Cleaning and Analysis Using SQL and Python

## Porject overview

This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, data integrity checking, and basic analytics using SQL, with visualization integration in Python. I used SQL for data preparation and data cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into customer purchasing behaviors. Python was used to create visualizations that complement SQL insights, showcasing my ability to bridge data processing and data science with these tools.
